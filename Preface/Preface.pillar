!!What is Pharo?

Pharo is a modern, open-source, dynamically typed language supporting live
coding inspired by Smalltalk. Pharo and its ecosystems are composed of six
fundamental elements:

- A dynamically-typed language with a syntax so simple it can fit on a postcard and yet is readable even for someone unfamiliar with it.
- A live coding environment that allows the programmer to modify code while the code executes, without any need to slow down their workflow.
- A powerful IDE providing all the tools to help manage complex code and promote good code design.
- A rich library that creates an environment so powerful that it can be viewed even as a virtual OS, including a very fast JITing VM and full access to OS libraries and features via its FFI.
- A culture where changes and improvements are encouraged and highly valued.
- A community that welcomes coders from any corner of the world with any skill and any programming languages.

Pharo strives to offer a lean, open platform for professional software
development, as well as a robust and stable platform for research and
development into dynamic languages and environments. Pharo serves as the
reference implementation for the Seaside web development framework available at
*http://www.seaside.st*.

Pharo core contains only code that has been contributed under the MIT license.
The Pharo project started in March 2008 as a fork of Squeak (a modern
implementation of Smalltalk-80), and the first 1.0 beta version was
released on July 31, 2009. The current version is Pharo 5.0, released in May
2016. Pharo 6.0 is in alpha development and planned for release in April 2017.

Pharo is highly portable. Pharo can run on OS X, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS,
and Raspberry Pi. Its virtual machine is written entirely in a subset of Pharo
itself, making it easy to simulate, debug, analyze, and change from within Pharo
itself. Pharo is the vehicle for a wide range of innovative projects, from
multimedia applications and educational platforms to commercial web development
environments.

There is an important principle behind Pharo: Pharo does not just copy the past,
it reinvents the essence of Smalltalk. However we realize that Big Bang style
approaches rarely succeed. Pharo instead favors evolutionary and incremental
changes. Rather than leaping for the final perfect solution in one big step, a
multitude of small changes keeps even the bleeding edge relatively stable while
experimenting with important new features and libraries. This facilitates
contributions and rapid feedback from the community, on which Pharo relies on
for its success. Finally Pharo is not read-only, Pharo integrates changes made
by the community, daily. Pharo has around 100 contributors, based all over the
world. You can have an impact on Pharo too!


!!Who should read this book?

The previous revision of this book was based on Pharo 1.4. This revision has
been liberally updated to align with Pharo 5.0. Various aspects of Pharo are
presented, starting with the basics then proceeding to intermediate topics.
Advanced topics are presented in ""Deep into Pharo"", a book on the internals of
Pharo that is freely available at *http://books.pharo.org*. In addition for
readers interested in web development, a new book ""Enterprise Pharo: a Web
Perspective"" is freely available at *http://books.pharo.org*.

This book will not teach you how to program. The reader should have some
familiarity with programming languages. Some background with object-oriented
programming would also be helpful.

This book will introduce the Pharo programming environment, the language and the
associated tools. You will be exposed to common idioms and practices, but the
focus is on the technology, not on object-oriented design. Wherever possible,
we will show you lots of examples.

There are numerous other books on Smalltalk freely available on the web at
*http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks.html*.

!!A word of advice

Do not be frustrated by parts of Pharo that you do not immediately understand.
You do not have to know everything! Alan Knight expresses this as follows:

{{{latex:\begin{quote} }}}{{{html:<blockquote>}}}
''Try not to care''. Beginning Smalltalk programmers often have trouble because they think they need to understand all the details of how a thing works before they can use it. This means it takes quite a while before they can master Transcript show: 'Hello World'. One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to answer the question “How does this work?” with "I don't care".
{{{latex:\end{quote} }}}{{{html:</blockquote>}}}

When you do not understand something, simple or complex, do not hesitate for a
second to ask us at our mailing lists (pharo-users@lists.pharo.org or
pharo-dev@lists.pharo.org), irc and Slack. We love questions and we welcome
people of any skill.

!!The Pharo community

The Pharo community is friendly and active. Here is a short list of resources
that you may find useful:

- *http://www.pharo.org>http://www.pharo.org* is the main web site of Pharo.
- On IRC, you can find us on the freenode.net server, channel "pharo".
- SmalltalkHub (*http://www.smalltalkhub.com/>http://www.smalltalkhub.com/*) is the equivalent of SourceForge/Github for Pharo projects. Many extra packages and projects for Pharo live there.
- Pharo is also active on Slack - a platform for chat based on IRC (*http://pharoproject.slack.com*), just ask for an invitation on Pharo's website *http://pharo.org/community*, in the slack section. Everybody is welcomed.

!!Examples and exercises

We have tried to provide as many examples as possible. In particular, there are
many examples that show a fragment of code which can be evaluated. We use a long
arrow to indicate the result you obtain when you select an expression and from
its context menu choose ""print it"":

[[[testcase=true|label=scr:script1|caption=Small example|language=Smalltalk
3 + 4
>>> 7 "if you select 3+4 and 'print it', you will see 7"
]]]

In case you want to play with these code snippets in Pharo, you can download a
plain text file with all the example code from the Resources sidebar of the
book's web site: *http://books.pharo.org>http://books.pharo.org*.


!!Acknowledgments

We would like to thank Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and their team for making Squeak,
an amazing Smalltalk development environment, that became the open-source
project from which Pharo took roots. Pharo also would not be possible without
the incredible work of the Squeak developers.

We would also like to thank Hilaire Fernandes and Serge Stinckwich who allowed
us to translate parts of their columns on Smalltalk, and Damien Cassou for
contributing the chapter on Streams. We especially thank Alexandre Bergel, Orla
Greevy, Fabrizio Perin, Lukas Renggli, Jorge Ressia and Erwann Wernli for their
detailed reviews.

We thank the University of Bern, Switzerland, for graciously supporting this
open-source project and for hosting the web site of this book.

We also thank the Pharo community for their enthusiastic support of this book
project, as well as for all the translations of the first edition of ""Pharo by
Example"".

!!Hyper special acknowledgments

We want to thank the original authors of this book! Without this initial version
it would have been difficult to make this one. Pharo by Example is a central
book to welcome newcomers and it has a great value.

Thanks to Manfred Kröhnert, Markus Schlager, Werner Kassens, Michael OKeefe,
Aryeh Hoffman, Paul MacIntosh, Gaurav Singh, Jigyasa Grover, Craig Allen, Serge
Stinckwich, avh-on1, Yuriy Timchuk, zio-pietro for the typos and feedback.
Special thanks to Damien Cassou and Cyril Ferlicot for their great help in the
book update. Finally we want to thank Inria for its steady and important
financial support, and the RMoD team members for the constant energy pushing
Pharo forward.

Super special thanks to Damien Pollet for this great book template.
