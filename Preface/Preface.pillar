!Preface

!!What is Pharo?

Pharo is a modern, open-source, fully-featured dynamically-typed language
inspired by the Smalltalk programming language and environment.  Pharo strives
to offer a lean, open platform for professional software development, as well as
a robust and stable platform for research and development into dynamic languages
and environments. Pharo serves as the reference implementation for the Seaside
web development framework available at *http://www.seaside.st*.

Pharo core contains only code that has been contributed under the MIT license.
The Pharo project started in March 2008, and the first 1.0 beta version was
released on July 31, 2009. The current version is Pharo 4.0, released in April
2015. Pharo 5.0 is in alpha development.

Pharo is highly portable - even its virtual machine is written entirely in
Pharo, making it easy to debug, analyze, and change.  Pharo is the vehicle for a
wide range of innovative projects, from multimedia applications and educational
platforms to commercial web development environments.

There is an important principle behind Pharo: Pharo should not just be a copy of
the past, but reinvent Smalltalk. We realize that Big Bang style approaches
rarely succeed.  Pharo will instead favor evolutionary and incremental changes.
We want to be able to experiment with important new features and libraries.
Evolution means that Pharo accepts mistakes and is not aiming for the next
perfect solution in one big step - even if we would love it.  Pharo will favor
small incremental changes, but a multitude of them. The success of Pharo depends
on the contributions of its community.

!!Who should read this book?

This book is based on *Pharo by Example>http://www.pharobyexample.org*.  It has
been liberally adapted and revised to reflect the differences between Pharo 1.4
and Pharo 4.0. This book presents the various aspects of Pharo, starting with
the basics, and proceeding to more advanced topics.

This book will not teach you how to program. The reader should have some
familiarity with programming languages.  Some background with object-oriented
programming would also be helpful.

This book will introduce the Pharo programming environment, the language and the
associated tools.  You will be exposed to common idioms and practices, but the
focus is on the technology, not on object-oriented design.  Wherever possible,
we will show you lots of examples. We have been inspired by Alec Sharp’s
excellent book on Smalltalk  (Alec Sharp, *Smalltalk by
Example>Http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/ByExample*. McGraw-Hill,
1997).

There are numerous other *books on Smalltalk freely available on the
web>http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks.html* but none of  these focuses
specifically on Pharo.

"Deep into Pharo" is a new book on the internals of Pharo. It is freely
available at *http://www.deepintopharo.org*

!!A word of advice

Do not be frustrated by parts of Pharo that you do not immediately understand.
You do not have to know everything! Alan Knight expresses this as follows:

""Try not to care"". Beginning Smalltalk programmers often have trouble because
they think they need to understand all the details of how a thing works before
they can use it.  This means it takes quite a while before they can master
Transcript show: 'Hello World'. One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to
answer the  question “How does this work?” with "I don't care".

!!An open book

-This book just describes the core of Pharo. We encourage others to contribute chapters on the parts of Pharo that we have not described. If you would like to participate in this effort, please contact us. We would like to see more books around Pharo!

-It also possible to contribute directly to this book via Github. Just follow the instructions there and ask any question on the mailing list.

!!The Pharo community

The Pharo community is friendly and active. Here is a short list of resources
that you may find useful:

- *http://www.pharo.org>http://www.pharo.org* is the main web site of Pharo.
- On IRC, you can find us on the freenode.net server, channel "pharo".
- You can also ask questions on Stack Overflow, using the tags *pharo>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pharo* and *smalltalk>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/smalltalk*.
- SmalltalkHub (*http://www.smalltalkhub.com/>http://www.smalltalkhub.com/*)
is the equivalent of SourceForge/Github for Pharo projects. Many extra packages
and projects for Pharo live there.

!!Examples and exercises

We have tried to provide as many examples as possible. In particular, there are
many examples that show a fragment of code which can be evaluated. We use the
symbol ==-->== an expression and to indicate the result that you obtain when you
select an expression and ""print it"":

[[[label=mth:script1|caption=Small example|language=Smalltalk
3 + 4
	--> 7 "if you select 3+4 and 'print it', you will see 7"
]]]

In case you want to play with these code snippets in Pharo, you can download a
plain text file with all the example code from the book's web site:

!!Acknowledgments

We would first like to thank Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls and their team for making
Squeak, this amazing Smalltalk development environment, available as an
open-source project from which Pharo took roots.

We would also like to thank Hilaire Fernandes and Serge Stinckwich who allowed
us to translate parts of their columns on Smalltalk, and Damien Cassou for
contributing the chapter on Streams. We especially thank Alexandre Bergel, Orla
Greevy, Fabrizio Perin, Lukas Renggli, Jorge Ressia and Erwann Wernli for their
detailed reviews.

We thank the University of Bern, Switzerland, for graciously supporting this
open-source project and for hosting the web site of this book.

We also thank the Pharo community for their enthusiastic support of this book
project, as well as for all the translations of the first edition of "Pharo by
Example".

Finally we want to thank Inria for its steady and important financial support,
and the RMoD team members for the constant energy pushing Pharo forward.
